                <p>Whitewater rafting is an exhilarating outdoor adventure that involves navigating a river's
                    fast-moving currents and turbulent rapids using an inflatable raft. This thrilling water sport
                    combines teamwork, physical endurance, and excitement as paddlers work together to steer through
                    various levels of rapids, ranging from gentle flows to intense, roaring waters. Often set against
                    scenic mountain or forest landscapes, whitewater rafting offers both a rush of adrenaline and a
                    chance to connect with nature.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Whitewater rafting has its roots in the early 19th century when explorers and military teams used wooden
                rafts to navigate rivers in the American West. The first recorded whitewater rafting trip took place in
                1811 on the Snake River in Wyoming, though it ended unsuccessfully due to the lack of proper equipment.
                In the 1940s and 1950s, rubber rafts developed for the military were repurposed for recreation, sparking
                interest in the sport. By the 1970s, whitewater rafting gained popularity as a commercial activity,
                especially in the U.S. and Europe, and it eventually became a recognized adventure sport around the
                world.</p>
